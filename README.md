[DONE] currently wokring on cropping functionality. the current implementation is not that smooth.

[DONE] also the selection and overalry div appears in the screenshot.
this is not the desired approach

[DONE] the cleaner approach - 
take ss before showing overlay, and that ss ke upar se we will crop. not the actual tab. that way it also gives us a freezing effect, coz currently the user can scroll while scrolling is active.

image-hover = this goes out of screen if it is on the edge already

allow multiple snips to be floating

[DONE] existing image right-click = to floating

enlarge-on-hover - can be made better by requiring to press Ctrl. current is out-of-controlish

needs resize option - initial can be kept in many options - oroginal size, small thumbanail, medium thumbnail &&& and then give expanded wale options too - original size, fit screen, etc etc
