currently wokring on cropping functionality. the current implementation is not that smooth.

also the selection and overalry div appears in the screenshot. 
this is not the desired approach

the cleaner approach - 
take ss before showing overlay, and that ss ke upar se we will crop. not the actual tab. that way it also gives us a freezing effect, coz currently the user can scroll while scropping is active.
